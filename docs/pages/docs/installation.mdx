## Binary Releases

We are now shipping binaries for each of the releases so that you don't even have to build them yourself! How wonderful is that!

If you're stupid enough to trust binaries that I've put together, you can download them from the [releases](https://github.com/LeoFVO/gossti/releases) page.

## Using `go install`

If you have a [Go](https://golang.org/) environment ready to go (at least go 1.19), it's as easy as:

```bash
go install github.com/LeoFVO/gossti@latest
```

PS: You need at least go 1.19 to compile gossti.

## Using Docker

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/leofvo/gossti:latest
docker run gossti:latest
```

## Building From Source

### Prerequisites

Since this tool is written in [Go](https://golang.org/) you need to install the Go language/compiler/etc. Full details of installation and set up can be found [on the Go language website](https://golang.org/doc/install). Once installed you have two options. You need at least go 1.19 to compile gossti.

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:LeoFVO/gossti.git
```

### Compiling

`gossti` has external dependencies, and so they need to be pulled in first:

```bash
go get && go build
```

This will create a `gossti` binary for you. If you want to install it in the `$GOPATH/bin` folder you can run:

```bash
go install
```

## Updating plugins database

By default, when installing GoSSTI you will not be able to launch scan as you don't have the plugins installed (excepted if you install from source and keep folder).  
You will need to update the plugins database by running the following command:

```bash
gossti plugins update
```
